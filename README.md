The headers that HASHBANG Productions uses. Headers are only created for classes we need, and only methods that we use are added to them. Feel free to use these (`git clone git://github.com/hbang/headers.git $THEOS/include` - if you have an existing `$THEOS/include` directory, rename it) and add on to them.
